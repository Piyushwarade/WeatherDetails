This Project basically gives description about current 5 day weather report of city.

It uses Open Weather Map API's to fetch the weather data.

This project is built in Express.js which is a framework based on node.js for building web-application (Backend) and Reactjs which is a javascript library for building user interfaces (Frontend).

client/src folder in the framework contains (React) Weather - component,action,reducer.

bin/www file contains server details while routes/weather.js file contains application logic.

test/test_weatherDetails.js has case to test API.

"mocha" is installed globally for test cases.

Run command "npm install" to install node_modules followed by "npm start" to start the backend server in OpenWeatherProject folder.

Run command "npm install" to install node_modules followed by "npm start" to start the frontend server in OpenWeatherProject/client.

Open browser with url "https://localhost:3000" to replicate the UI.

Run command mocha in OpenWeatherProject folder to test API.

Thanks.
